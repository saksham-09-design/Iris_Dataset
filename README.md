# 🌸 Iris Dataset Exploration & Classification

*A Data Science Project using Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn & Python*

## 📘 Overview

This project explores the classic **Iris dataset**, performs **data visualization**, and builds **machine learning models** using **DecisionTreeClassifier** and **RandomForestClassifier** to classify iris flower species.

The goal is to understand the dataset, visualize key features, train predictive models, and evaluate their performance.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The **Iris dataset** contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three species:

* *Setosa*
* *Versicolor*
* *Virginica*

Each sample includes four features:

* 🌿 Sepal Length
* 🌿 Sepal Width
* 🌼 Petal Length
* 🌼 Petal Width

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading

* Loaded from **Scikit-Learn’s built-in datasets**.

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Using **Matplotlib**, several visualizations were created:

* 📊 Bar Plots for Visualisations

### 3️⃣ Model Training

Two models were used for prediction:

#### 🌳 **Decision Tree Classifier**

* Simple, explainable model
* Good for baseline accuracy

#### 🌲🌲 **Random Forest Classifier**

* Ensemble of multiple decision trees
* Higher accuracy & generalization capability

## 🧪 Technologies Used

* **Python 3.13**
* **Matplotlib** for visualization
* **Scikit-Learn** for ML models
* **NumPy & Pandas** for data handling
* **Jupyter Notebook** for development

---

## 📈 Results

* Both models performed well on the dataset
* Visualizations gave clear insights into feature separability, especially petal measurements
